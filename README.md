Users enter a location within the boundaries of Los Angeles County and are presented with up to 20,000 data points
for the current year and two previous years for within the bounds of the map window. A chart is rendered displaying monthly
sums for each year as well as an average per month statistic. Totals are displayed per year as well. Users are able to
reposition the map manually using the drag or zoom features (with zoom bounds to preserve data integrity). Each reposition
refreshes the crime data displayed on the page. Users are also presented with markers and clusters on the map in order to
visualize the crime density in their chosen areas.

Technologies used: HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery
This page utilizes Google Maps, Google Charts, and data from data.lacity.org (Crimes 2010-Present)
